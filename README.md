VectorAddition
==============

A code example from a UPEI Engn 132 assignment for a class presentation.

From the assignment:
Problem 4.1

(Using functions) 
Write a C program with ‘user-defined functions’, which calculates the 
resultant (magnitude and angle) vector arising from the addition of two input 
vectors.

Input vectors will have the form: 

magnitude_1 angle_1 
magnitude_2 angle_2, 

where angle is measured in the counterclockwise direction from the positive 
x-axis. Thus, angles will have values between 0 degrees and 359.9 degrees. 
As part of the output, ensure that at a minimum, the following ‘test cases’ 
are included with your solution: 

a. 1∠0° + 1∠90° = 1.41∠45° 

b. 1∠90° + 1∠180° = 1.41∠135° 

c. 1∠180° + 1∠270° = 1.41∠225° 

d. 1∠270° + 1∠0° = 1.41∠315° 

Please note: generation of the correct angle will require basic ‘decision 
statements’ which are covered in Chapter 4. 

HINT: when developing your flowchart, consider calculations that are 
repeated – these are the processes that should be considered for ‘user-
defined functions’.
